## 70
- 70 contains our shared component library, representing 70% of common components shared across projects. It is a Pattern Lab instance intended for reference and prototyping, and is intentionally platform agnostic, i.e. not tied to a CMS

## Docs
- Docs contains other relevant reference material for topics such as installation, configuration, and how-to guides on pattern oriented development

## Workshop
- Workshop contains an experimental component library, featuring components from past projects or proposed for future ones, but which have not been formally included in the REPEAT 70 library
